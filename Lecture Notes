“Study the past if you define the future” - Confucius 

01. Project: Type Specimen Poster (Deadline 12/09/17)

This week we were asked to begin our first project. We have been given a list of font names and have to choose one. I have chosen to look at either Bodoni or Garamond to begin the research for my poster. (A3 420 x 297)mm.

02. Tumblr

We have also been asked to begin uploading our work each week to our Tumblr site. 

Wilson Miner -When We Build (reflection of video)

I found this video to be very inspiring as someone with a keen interest in design. Miner starts off with the quote “They are just tools that fulfil a need and take us where we want to go”. This quote has a real truth behind it as with everything we design it is shaping our future. Marshall McLuhan said “We shape our tools, and therefore our tools shape us”. The things that we create are creating a new environment around us and by introducing and designing new things gives us a new outlook into society. 

He says we must ask ourselves ‘What do we want that environment to feel like?’ so we should design based on what we want the future to become. Miner says as designers we take a lot of information for granted because we’ve already learnt it but it’s not enough to rely on what we know or what other people know. He says that if the environment is constantly changing then we need to be constantly learning from it. 

‘We get to make things, something small but certainly meaningful’. 

I found this quote to be particularly inspiring. When it comes to design some of the best seem so simple, for example Apple. All of Apples products are so simple and clean looking but they have created such an impact on the world. So by saying that we make something small but certainly meaningful is very true and allows us to see that even the smallest of ideas can be the ones that create the biggest impact.
